<div class="container" ng-controller="DashboardCtrl">
<!-- show the current order and the steps -->
    <h1>{{activityName}}</h1>
<!-- show steps and highlights based on each movement -->

<!-- Example

    Quicksort: Show the base order, darken the pivot value, then
    highlight the left pointer, move pointer until the value is
    greater than or equal to pivot value, then start with right
    pointer and move until pointer is less than or equal to pivot
    swap the two values and show the next line
    continue moving the pointers until they cross and repeat the
    steps until all numbers are sorted properly

    Switch: Set one studentlogin as a random item, then the others as cases and one as default case
    On screen show each step of the switch statement and highlight the correct value based on
    studentlogin selection

    Decimal to Binary: display the number show the binary bits below
    on top show the numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
    below show 0's and flip the bits to 1 if the value is less than or equal to the current value
    once the binary numbers add to the correct value show that as final answer.
