    <!-- show the current order and the steps -->

    <!-- show steps and highlights based on each movement -->

    <!-- Example

        Quicksort: Show the base order, darken the pivot value, then
        highlight the left pointer, move pointer until the value is
        greater than or equal to pivot value, then start with right
        pointer and move until pointer is less than or equal to pivot
        swap the two values and show the next line
        continue moving the pointers until they cross and repeat the
        steps until all numbers are sorted properly

        Switch: Set one student as a random item, then the others as cases and one as default case
        On screen show each step of the switch statement and highlight the correct value based on
        student selection

        Decimal to Binary: display the number show the binary bits below
        on top show the numbers 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
        below show 0's and flip the bits to 1 if the value is less than or equal to the current value
        once the binary numbers add to the correct value show that as final answer.
